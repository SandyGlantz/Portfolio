# Portfolio
Overview with quick links to code and projects ... a work in progress!

A true learning experience involved losing almost all my GitHub activity prior to December 2017.  There was a lot of activity too (sigh ...).  Fortunately, all my files were backed up so there was no data loss - just losing all those little greeen activity squares was not my intention ;-)


Links need to be embedded and cleaned up here ...


Fun stuff first; Pizza For Cats:
HTML/JavaScript/CSS

Still lots to do on this:
